== SearchMatcher

Perform a search on a SequenceMatcher problem.
In this problem, we are trying to construct a `target` string
through a concurrent random walk using only the string similarity ratio to
guide progress.

=== Usage

----
$ python workflow.py | out.txt
----

The tail of `out.txt` will show if the search succeeded and what the best matches found were.

=== Configuration

In `workflow.py`, the `start_count`, `start_length`, and `target` settings configure the difficulty of the search.
